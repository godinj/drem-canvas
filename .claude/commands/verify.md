Read the CLAUDE.md in the current directory and find the "Verification" section. For each verification criterion listed:

1. Build the project (`cmake --build build`)
2. Review the code to determine whether each criterion is met based on the implementation
3. Report a checklist with pass/fail/partial status for each criterion
4. For any failures, explain what's missing and suggest what to implement

If there is no Verification section in CLAUDE.md, check PRD.md for the relevant phase's "Verify" step instead.
